# Stock-Price-Prediction
## Project Overview : 
One of the top applications of machine learning is stock price analysis, which has been a critical area of research. In this notebook, I attempted to analyze Tesla stock market data using some EDA techniques, then trained and tested the data on several machine learning models before selecting the best two for hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.
